## 🏠 About

Before taking action, humans make predictions based on their objectives and observations of the current environment. These predictions manifest in various forms, \eg, textual planning, visual imagination of future scene changes, or even subconscious planning at the action level. Each of these predictive capabilities is critical to the successful completion of tasks. With the development of generative models, agents driven by these models are exhibiting predictive capabilities that enable them to complete embodied tasks by making human-like predictions, high-level planning, image-based guidance, or future video prediction to drive actions. We refer to these models as World Models. Recently, these models have been widely applied across various domains spanning from developing agents to solve inference tasks to leveraging predictions for driving robots to perform specific actions.
